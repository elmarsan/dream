# Dream

A simple daemon that allows you to use gif as background in gnome desktop.
Daemon runs in background doing gif frame transitioning.

## Usage

1. Compile: `go build`
2. Run: `/dream`
3. (Optional) Send stop signal: `./dream -s stop` 

## Disclarimer

This code is just a small proof of concept, it's not optimal and probably will eat your system resources.
I do not recommend using.
